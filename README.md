# BookScraping

In this software I collect books from website called "https://openlibrary.org/" and save every readable book to my database with its cover picture, book name, and author.

The website "https://openlibrary.org/" contains different type of functionalities e.g you can read the book online, preview the book without reading, borrowing the book.
So the software has to identify which book can be readable. After finding the readable books I save their links then download them to my PC and then upload them to the
datebase.
